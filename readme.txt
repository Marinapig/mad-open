Simple alternative to xdg-open written in C.

I got annoyed by xdg-opens configuration files (mimeapps.list, *desktop), so I
decided to write my own program to do the same thing.

I'm new to C programming so if there are any deficiencies in this program
please make an issue or a pull request, thanks.
